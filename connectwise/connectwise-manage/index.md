# Connectwise Manage

>**Important**: This integration is scheduled to go through a new verification cycle. The documentation provided for this integration is based on older versions of Secret Server and ConnectWise Manage.

## Managing Customer Privileged Accounts

Integrating the Secret Server folder structure with ConnectWise company information allows companies to quickly organize their privileged accounts based on the customers they are managing in ConnectWise. This integration helps
eliminate the need to manually update the same data in two different systems.

### The Secret Server Approach to Privileged Account Management 

Many environments with strict Information Security policies require methods to control and monitor access to privileged accounts. Companies often apply security policies such as physical access restrictions to hardware, network
firewalls, appropriate-use guidelines, and user account restrictions. In the case of privileged accounts, access is more difficult to track and verify. Implementing Secret Server enables organizations to strictly control and track
access to both customer and internal privileged accounts.

### Secret Server ConnectWise Integration Explained

Secret Server has the ability to read the list of companies via the ConnectWise API and populate Folders based on Companies and Status.
