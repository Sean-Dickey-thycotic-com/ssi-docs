To set up this feature, click **Folder Synchronization** from the **Administration** menu.

>**Note**: For the ability to edit these settings, an administrator must be assigned a role within Secret Server containing the Administer ConnectWise
Integration permission.

Enabling Folder Synchronization will require specifying the synchronization interval in days, hours, and minutes. Folder to Synchronize references the
parent folder where Secret Server will create the ConnectWise companies as child folders.
