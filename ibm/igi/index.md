# IBM IGI
The integration between Thycotic Secret Server and IBM IGI is created and maintained by IBM. This document provides guidance and best practice for implementing the integration. It is based on the following publicly available documentation from IBM and testing performed by Thycotic. Integrations are supported to the extent of the third-party product procedures documented for this integration. Please contact the third-party for any customized setup of the integrated product.

Why should IBM IGI be Integrated with Thycotic Secret Server?
IBM Secret Server now integrates with IBM Identity Governance & Intelligence (IGI) to provide an enhanced privileged identity and access governance solution. IBM Secret Server securely stores privileged credentials and other sensitive information, known as secrets, and provides visibility into who has access to those secrets. IGI ensures that users’ access levels are compliant with regulations and prevent SoD violations.

By integrating these two products, organizations can centrally manage and control all identities, including privileged identities and entitlements. Compliance use cases such as managing entitlements, certification, new user provisioning, and application access permissions are now unified for both privileged and non-privileged users. This integration unifies processes for privileged and non-privileged users. It ensures that privileged users are granted appropriate access permissions based on similar privileged users’ attributes (e.g. job role, department), and in accordance with the organization’s access policy. It reduces the attack surface and enhances regulatory compliance by limiting access privileges and deactivating orphan privileged accounts. It streamlines governance and compliance processes by generating reports and auditing all identities and access permissions directly from IGI.
