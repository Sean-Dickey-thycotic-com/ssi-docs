# JDBC Driver Proxy

## Introduction

The JDBC Proxy Driver is an additional component that securely and automatically manages database server credentials that are stored inside the java web application configuration file. The JDBC Proxy Driver allows you to store your passwords securely in the Secret Server Vault, and perform automatic password replacement with no need to restart the Application Server, thus eliminating downtime.
