# ConnectWise Control Integrations with Secret Server

ConnectWise Control is a self-hosted remote desktop software application.  ConnectWise Control has a proprietary protocol but does allow users to implement custom extensions.   The Secret Server integrations is implemented as an extension which is accessible via the helper window.
The on site ConnectWise Control server is self-hosted, and runs as a .NET Framework application. On Microsoft Windows it runs as a set of services. On Linux and OS X it runs as a daemon.  ConnectWise Control launched a cloud platform in 2015, providing another way to use the ConnectWise Control software with no local server installation required.

The integration between Secret Server and ConnectWise Control ensures that:

* Passwords are securely vaulted in Secret Server.
* Users can connect to a Secret Server instance.
* Users can search and select folders.
* Users can search and select secrets located within a folder.
* Users can pass the userid/password (and domain) to the Connected Machine.
* All access by users is captures in Secret Server Audit Trail.
