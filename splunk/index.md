## Summary
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> el.dev.163057.splunk

Splunk Enterprise software that enables you to search, analyze, and visualize
the data gathered by your IT infrastructure, in this case, Secret Server (SS).
Splunk is a quick way to get analysis of and reporting on the health and use of
on-premises SS.

After defining the data source, Splunk Enterprise indexes the data stream and
parses it into a series of individual events that can be viewed and searched.

## Integration Scope

SS event data with Splunk SIEM solutions can give organizations deep insight
into privileged account usage (such as Windows local administrator, service or
application accounts, UNIX root accounts, Cisco enable passwords and more). Used
together, these tools provide secure access to privileged accounts and provide
greater visibility to meet compliance mandates and detect internal network
threats.

## Conclusion

Organizations that need to meet strict compliance requirements can implement
privileged account management and real-time event analysis using SS and Splunk.
Integrating these two products allows enterprises to both manage their
privileged accounts and correlate and reduce security threats within a network.
