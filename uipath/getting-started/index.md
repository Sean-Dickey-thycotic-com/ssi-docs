# Getting Started with UiPath Orchestrator Integration for Secret Server

Prior to installing and configuring UiPath orchestrator you will need to make sure you have Administrator access to your Secret Server instance. The Application User linked to the client SDK rule must have permissions to the Secrets accessed by UI Path, you can assign it to a group and grant that group access to the required folders, or grant it explicit access to the Secrets.
