## Support for ThycoticCentrify Integrations

__Prerequisites:__ As a prerequisite of support for any ThycoticCentrify integrations the customer must have sufficient access to the ThycoticCentrify product and all parts of the third-party integration and must be able to provide ThycoticCentrify with requested information and meetings to examine in order to progress reported issues.

### ThycoticCentrify In Product Integrations

Integrations that are directly built into paid ThycoticCentrify products will be supported by the ThycoticCentrify support team and defects will be handled by the ThycoticCentrify product developers who maintain the ThycoticCentrify product where the issue occurs.

### ThycoticCentrify In Product Customization

Many ThycoticCentrify products can be customized in order to achieve an integration between the ThycoticCentrify product and third-party systems. If ThycoticCentrify documents an integration as a supported integration the integration will be configured as specified in our documentation in QA to ensure that it works as designed at regular intervals.

### ThycoticCentrify Created Unpaid Integrations

Unpaid integrations created by ThycoticCentrify are code or applications that are not sold by Thycotic for monetary compensation. They are provided for the use of ThycoticCentrify customers and in some cases are available to the public.

An example of this type of integration would be the RabbitMQ Helper, migration tools created by ThycoticCentrify, and code provided on the Thycotic Github. These integrations will be tested in QA to ensure that they work as designed.

   >**Note:** Assistance with configuration or troubleshooting of these tools with third-party systems is not within the scope of what the ThycoticCentrify Support organization can provide at this time. ThycoticCentrify does not guarantee that every configuration of third-party systems will work with Unpaid Integrations.

### Third Party Integrations to ThycoticCentrify

This category of integration encompasses any code or script which integrates with ThycoticCentrify usually by __API__ that is written by a third-party vendor. Thycotic does not guarantee that third-party code is written correctly or that it respects ThycoticCentrify product limitations.

For instance, the third-party code may fail to respect Token expiry or issue calls too quickly without waiting for responses and time-outs. Third-party integrations are supported by verifying that the ThycoticCentrify application is functioning correctly. ThycoticCentrify does not support, code or maintain third-party code or scripts.

For commercially sold third-party products which have vendor support will at ThycoticCentrify's discretion, if the third-party product can provide a knowledgeable resource, ThycoticCentrify may elect to attend calls with the third-party vendor if they are able to share specifics about how they integrate with the ThycoticCentrify application. __The goal of such calls would be to advise the third-party vendor about what they need to change to better integrate with ThycoticCentrify products__.
