__SafeNet Data Protection on Demand (DPoD)__: It is a cloud-based platform that
provides on-demand HSM and key management services through a simple graphical
user interface. With DPoD, security is simple, cost effective, and easy to
manage because there is no hardware to buy, deploy, and maintain. As an
Application Owner, you click and deploy services, generate usage reports and
maintain only the services that you need.
